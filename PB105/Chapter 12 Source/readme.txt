The source program for Visual C++ to realize PBNI extension under the PBNIAdd directory;
The PBNIAdd\Debug directory is the compiled and debug generated files for Visual C++ to realize the PBNI extension. "pbniadd.dll" and "pbniadd.pbx" are the files generated by Visual C++ under the condition of setting the output type to DLL and PBX respectively. You can use pbx2pbd The tool converts it into a PBD file, and then uses it in PowerBuilder 9.0. For specific methods, please refer to the content in the book;
The source program of PowerBuilder 9.0 is in this directory.

Note: If the user wants to use the source program directly in PowerBuilder 9.0, please copy all files to the local directory (for example: C:\pbni), modify and cancel the "read-only" attribute of all files, and then run in the DOS command line:
pbx2pbd90 "C:\pbni\pbniadd.pbd" "C:\pbni\pbniadd\debug\pbniadd.pbx"
If something similar to the following appears on the screen, it means success!
Adding file: C:\pbn\pbniadd\debug\PBNIADD.pbx into PBD:C:\pbn\pbniadd.pbd ... Succeeded!
